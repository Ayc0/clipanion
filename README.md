# Clipanion

> A companion to manage your CLI applications without hassle

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/clipanion.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/clipanion.svg)]()

## Installation

```
$> yarn add clipanion@2.0.0-rc.0
```

## Why

  - Clipanion supports both simple CLI and more complex ones with multiple level of commands (for example `yarn constraints fix`)
  - Clipanion supports proxy commands (for example `yarn run eslint --help`, where `--help` is an option that must be forwarded to `eslint`, not consumed by `yarn run`)
  - Clipanion supports a bunch of option types: boolean, counters (`-vv`), with arguments (`-x VAL`), arrays (`-x VAL ...`), negations (`--no-optionals`), ...
  - Clipanion supports parameter validation for when the default cohercion isn't enough (using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup))
  - Clipanion generates good-looking help pages

Clipanion is used in [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) with great success.

## Recommended Usage

**Note:** This syntax assumes you have some way to compile decorators. TypeScript supports them via the `experimentalDecorators` setting, and Babel via the `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` plugin.

```ts
import {Cli, Command, Context} from 'clipanion';
import * as yup                from 'yup';

class GreetCommand extends Command {
    @Command.Boolean(`-v,--verbose`)
    public verbose: boolean = false;

    @Command.String(`--name`)
    public name?: string;

    @Command.Path(`greet`)
    async execute(cli: Cli, context: Context) {
        if (typeof this.name === `undefined`) {
            context.stdout.write(`You're not registered.\n`);
        } else {
            context.stdout.write(`Hello, ${this.name}!\n`);
        }
    }
}

@Command.Validate(yup.object().shape({
    a: yup.number().integer(),
    b: yup.number().integer(),
}))
class FibonacciCommand extends Command {
    @Command.String({required: true})
    public a!: number;

    @Command.String({required: true})
    public b!: number;

    @Command.Path(`fibo`)
    async execute(cli: Cli, context: Context) {
        // ...
    }
}

const cli = new Cli({name: `test-bin`});

cli.register(GreetCommand);
cli.register(FibonacciCommand);

cli.runExit(process.argv.slice(2));
```
