> A companion to manage your CLI applications without hassle

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/clipanion.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/clipanion.svg)]()

## Installation

```
yarn add clipanion
```

## Why

  - Clipanion supports advanced typing mechanisms
  - Clipanion supports nested commands (`yarn workspaces list`)
  - Clipanion supports transparent option proxying without `--` (for example `yarn dlx eslint --fix`)
  - Clipanion supports all option types you could think of (including negations, batches, ...)
  - Clipanion offers a [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) integration for increased validation capabilities
  - Clipanion generates good-looking help pages out of the box

Clipanion is used in [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) with great success.

## Recommended Usage

**Note:** This syntax assumes you have some way to compile decorators. TypeScript supports them via the `experimentalDecorators` setting, and Babel via the `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` plugin.

```ts
import {Cli, Command, Context} from 'clipanion';
import * as yup from 'yup';

class GreetCommand extends Command {
    @Command.Boolean(`-v,--verbose`)
    public verbose: boolean = false;

    @Command.String(`--name`)
    public name?: string;

    @Command.Path(`greet`)
    async execute(cli: Cli, context: Context) {
        if (typeof this.name === `undefined`) {
            context.stdout.write(`You're not registered.\n`);
        } else {
            context.stdout.write(`Hello, ${this.name}!\n`);
        }
    }
}

@Command.Validate(yup.object().shape({
    a: yup.number().integer(),
    b: yup.number().integer(),
}))
class FibonacciCommand extends Command {
    @Command.String({required: true})
    public a!: number;

    @Command.String({required: true})
    public b!: number;

    @Command.Path(`fibo`)
    async execute(cli: Cli, context: Context) {
        // ...
    }
}

const cli = new Cli({
    binaryLabel: `My Utility`,
    binaryName: `bin`,
    binaryVersion: `1.0.0`,
});

cli.register(GreetCommand);
cli.register(FibonacciCommand);

cli.runExit(process.argv.slice(2));
```

## Fallback Usage

In case the primary syntax isn't available (for example because you want to avoid any kind of transpilation), a fallback syntax is available:

```js
class GreetCommand extends Command {
    async execute(cli, context) {
        // ...
    }
}

GreetCommand.addPath(`greet`);

GreetCommand.addOption(`boolean`, Command.Boolean(`-v,--verbose`));
GreetCommand.addOption(`name`, Command.String(`--name`));
```

Note that in this case the option variables never get assigned default values, so they may be undefined within the `execute` block.

## Command Help Pages

Clipanion automatically adds support for the `-h` option to all the commands that you define. The information printed will come from the `usage` property attached to the class. For example, the following command:

```ts
class YarnAdd extends Command {
    static usage = Command.Usage({
        description: `remove dependencies from the project`,
        details: `
            This command will remove the specified packages from the current workspace. If the \`-A,--all\` option is set, the operation will be applied to all workspaces from the current project.
        `,
        examples: [[
            `Remove a dependency from the current project`,
            `yarn remove lodash`,
        ], [
            `Remove a dependency from all workspaces at once`,
            `yarn remove lodash --all`,
        ]],
    });
}
```

Will generate something like this:

Note that the inline code blocks will be automatically highlighted.

## General Help Page

In order to support using the `-h` option to list the commands available to the application, just register a new command as such:

```ts
class HelpCommand extends Command {
  @Command.Path(`--help`)
  @Command.Path(`-h`)
  async execute() {
    this.context.stdout.write(this.cli.usage(null));
  }
}
```

This will print a block similar to the following:

## Composition

Commands can call each other by making use of their `cli` internal property:

```ts
class FooCommand extends Command {
    @Command.Path(`foo`)
    async execute() {
        this.context.stdout.write(`Hello World\n`);
    }
}

class BarCommand extends Command {
    @Command.Path(`bar`)
    async execute() {
        this.cli.run([`foo`]);
    }
}
```

## Contexts

Commands share what is called a *context*. Contexts are a set of values defined when calling the `run` function from the CLI instance that will be made available to the commands via `this.context`. The default context contains properties for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`, but you can easily define a custom context that extends the default one:

```ts
import {BaseContext, Command} from 'clipanion';

type MyContext = BaseContext & {
    cwd: string;
};

class PwdCommand extends Command<MyContext> {
    async execute() {
        this.context.stdout.write(`${this.context.cwd}\n`);
    }
}

const cli = Cli.from<MyContext>([
    PwdCommands,
]);

cli.runExit(process.argv.slice(2), {
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    stdin: process.std,
    stdout: process.stdout,
    stderr: process.stderr,
});
```

Note that the context must be fully defined when calling `run` and `runExit` on the main CLI instance, but can be omitted or only partially specified when using `this.cli.run` (in which case only the specified fields will be changed).
